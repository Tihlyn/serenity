## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Redis server
- Discord application with bot token

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install discord.js bullmq ioredis dotenv
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_discord_application_id
AUTHORIZED_USERS=user_id_1,user_id_2,user_id_3
EVENT_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id_for_events
```

3. Start Redis server:

I recommend running redis as a container for safety and ease of use

```bash
# On Linux/Mac with Homebrew
brew services start redis

# On Linux with systemd
sudo systemctl start redis

# Or run directly
redis-server
```

4. Run the bot:
```bash
node bot.js
```
